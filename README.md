# Finding Longest Delay Path in Combinational Circuit using Directed Acyclic Graph

## Overview
This project implements an algorithm to compute the longest weighted path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), representing a digital circuit netlist. By leveraging topological sorting and dynamic programming, the approach efficiently determines the critical delay path.

## Features
- **Adjacency List Representation:** The netlist is stored using an adjacency list for efficient traversal. Each edge (gate/net) is represented by its source node, destination node, and associated weight.
- **Topological Sorting:** Kahn's algorithm is used to generate a valid topological order of nodes in the DAG, ensuring each node is processed only after all its predecessors.
- **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Iterating through the topological order, the algorithm dynamically computes the maximum path weight for each node, updating paths accordingly. Primary inputs initialize the computation with a path weight of zero.
- **Path Extraction:** The longest weighted path is determined by comparing computed weights of all primary outputs, ultimately identifying the circuitâ€™s critical delay path.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.13
- Google Colab or other platform for Python coding
